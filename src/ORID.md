## Objective
Today, I learned about **three-layer architecture**, **service/controller testing**, and **JPA** in Spring Boot.

## Reflection
- Three-layer architecture improves modularity.
- Service and controller testing ensures logic and HTTP handling work correctly.
- JPA simplifies database interactions.

## Interpretation
- Three-layer structure makes code scalable.
- Testing improves reliability.
- JPA reduces SQL boilerplate.

## Decision
- Focus on service/controller testing and JPA.
- Use three-layer architecture in future projects.
